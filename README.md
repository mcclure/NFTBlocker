# Twitter Block Chain

This chrome extension helps users who have been retweeted and are likely to be, or currently being dog-piled.
By navigating to a user's followers (or following) page and activating the plugin, you can block all users on that page.

# FAQs 

I'm trying to use this as an unpacked extension and it isn't working?

You'll need to include jquery-1.11.2.min.js in the project folder.

How do I activate the plugin?

Browse to a following/followers page on twitter and click the icon in the toolbar on Chrome. If it says you're not on a following/followers page, try refreshing first.

How do I stop the blocking?

Click the X in the top right corner of the blocking report to stop all blocking. Note that this will not unblock any users you have already blocked.
